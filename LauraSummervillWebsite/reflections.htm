Before beginning Edmonds Community College CIS program, I had a very specific understanding of computer infomation concepts based on work projects. 
The courses in the CIS program have greatly broadened my understanding of computer systems and how businesses utilize them. 
The knowledge that I have aquired during my time at EDCC has been extremely value added in my career.

<p>
While studying the cloud computing associate's course materials, I have designed and built databases in both Microsoft Access and MySQL, utilized the systems development lifecycle to complete an application development project for the Edmonds Chamber of Commerce. 
I created an online, interactive poker game using Visual Basics and also created this website.

<p>
I have truly enjoyed my time in this program and all that I have learned. 
It will be extremely beneficial as I continue to manage more technically complex projects throughout my career.
